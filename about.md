I am a senior studying financial engineering at Montana State University with a minor in data science. I enjoy coding, statistics, math and open ended problem solving. I have experience using python, R, SQL, and Java for different analytical projects and problems.

Some of my other interestes include cooking, hiking, skiing, surfing and anything else outdoors. I also like to play guitar in my downtime.
